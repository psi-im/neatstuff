/*! \class QTcpSocket

    \brief The QTcpSocket class provides a TCP socket.

    \reentrant
    \ingroup io
    \module network

    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable,
    stream-oriented, connection-oriented transport protocol. It is
    especially well suited for continuous transmission of data.

    QTcpSocket is a convenience subclass of QAbstractSocket that
    allows you to establish a TCP connection and transfer streams of
    data. See the QAbstractSocket documentation for details.

    The \l{network/fortuneserver}{Fortune Server},
    \l{network/fortuneclient}{Fortune Client},
    \l{network/threadedfortuneserver}{Threaded Fortune Server}, and
    \l{network/blockingfortuneclient}{Blocking Fortune Client}
    examples illustrate how to use QTcpSocket in applications.

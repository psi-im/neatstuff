BYOQ (Bring Your Own Qt)
------------------------
Version: 0.1-20050204
Author: Justin Karneges <justin@affinix.com>
Date: February 4th, 2005

This is a bundle of Qt 4 (just the core, network, xml) intended for easy
inclusion within an existing application distribution.  As Qt 4 is still
in development, this package is based on a snapshot version.

It's basically the Qt distribution (sitting in the 'qt' subdirectory), with
the following changes:
  - some hacks on .pro files and such to ensure only core/network/xml
    are built, and only in debug mode
  - remove the licensing prompt (GPL is assumed)
  - many files not needed were deleted
  - added a 'byoq' script to do the building

To build: (does nothing if Qt is already built)
  ./byoq build

To clean:
  ./byoq clean

To force build:
  ./byoq cleanbuild
